    <section id="case-study-1">
        <h2>Case Study 1: Flexbox</h2>
        <p><strong>Background:</strong> This was done for a web development class; it demonstrates the properties of css flexbox containers and how to modify them and their contents. The project started from a template provided to the students. Students edited until the changes had been implemented correctly.  </p>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The problem of this project is to modify your code and be adaptable when problems inevitably ensue. Getting a page to display correctly requires attention to detail and the ability to adapt when needed. I selected this project for my portfolio because it shows a finished product that came as a direct result of adaptability.  </p>
        <p><strong>Process:</strong>We were given a template to work from with comments in our code to achieve the desired result. Iif the comments were responded to correctly then the page would function without error. Comments were meant to be completed from the top of the page to the bottom. Each comment would modify how the page displayed in real time so tracking the progress was critical for planning the next step and any backtracking. Once the comments were completed one last round of testing was completed to ensure each element worked and the page as a whole worked. </p>
        <p><strong>Results:</strong> Once all the comments were completed and testing was done the page works as intended and can be interacted with. Each element describes what is happening for that element. I think this is helpful, the viewer knows what each element does by its content. </p>

    <section id="case-study-2">
        <h2>Case Study 2: Basic Form</h2>
        <p><strong>Background:</strong> This was done for a web dev class, it is intended to show that the basics are important. It covers a simple form submission which is important because there is value in getting the basics right. There is great value in security, knowing what is happening when a user clicks on an item is important. </p>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The problem of this project is creating a site that a user can fill out and submit a form. The site is meant to be simple and clear. The submission does not save.  </p>
        <p><strong>Process:</strong> This was done from a file provided by the professor, the instructions were comments and students were instructed on how to create the document in the way the professor intended.</p>
        <p><strong>Results:</strong> The results of this project are a simple document, it demonstrates how small details matter. The basics are important to the core of a project, after that is what makes a product unique. </p>
